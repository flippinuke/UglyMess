# my learning process

# how to subset to view only certain columns of a table ====

### (IX) Inspecting goal data more thoroughly (and other nested data) ====
# Note: boring: mostly head() and str() type functions
### This is where I discovered that the data was in XML format
### I understand that I wrote a csv file to a folder - I did this so I could view it in Excel
### I understand that this is an R course, but soemtimes it's still easier for me just to
### look at it in Excel. I saw the same thing here ... it helped me figure it out eventually
